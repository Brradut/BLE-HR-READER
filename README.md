# BLE-Heart-Rate-Reader-
Android app used to read Heart Rate data from Bluetooth Low-Energy devices. Currently very bad and WIP.


To Run:
1.Make sure Bluetooth is enabled
2.Make sure Location is enabled
3.If any permissions are required, please give them
4.If the app doesn't find Bluetooth devices, try restarting it? 
5.After registering to a device, after around 1 minute some numbers should appear on the screen
